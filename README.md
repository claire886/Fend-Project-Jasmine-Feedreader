This project is an assignment of Front-End Web Developer Program Degree from Udacity. It helps to learn how to use Jasmine to write a number of tests against a pre-existing application.

### How to run this application

First, please open file 'index.html.' After the page finishing loading, please scroll down to the bottom of the page. You will find Jasmine section. In this section, it shows you there are 7 specs, and all specs are passed.

### Where to find Jasmine test code

Please open file 'feedreader.js' under 'jasmine/spec.' You would find all the Jasmine test code here. The test code involves DOM elements in 'index.html' file, and it also refers function and variables in 'js/app.js' file. Understanding 'index.html' and 'app.js' would help to follow the test code.
